Hello Conor,

I created this email using a Jinja template. 

Jinja makes it very easy to create documents of any kind, for example I can easily print a list of things:

- cat
- dog
- mouse
- elephant


If I want to only show some things I can use a conditional statement
        The number 1 is odd!
        The number 2 is even!
        The number 3 is odd!
        The number 4 is even!
        The number 5 is odd!
        The number 6 is even!
        The number 7 is odd!
        The number 8 is even!
        The number 9 is odd!
        The number 10 is even!
        The number 11 is odd!
        The number 12 is even!
        The number 13 is odd!
        The number 14 is even!
        The number 15 is odd!
        The number 16 is even!
        The number 17 is odd!
        The number 18 is even!
        The number 19 is odd!
