    "##### `A bit about Numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Numpy` is a library in Python that is used for working with arrays. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object and tools for working with these arrays. Here are some of its main uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mathematical and Logical Operations on Arrays: Numpy allows element-wise operations, which means you can easily perform operations (addition, subtraction, square, exponentials) on every element of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fourier Transforms and Shapes Manipulation: Numpy can perform Fourier transforms and reshape arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matrix Operations: Numpy is capable of performing various matrix operations like multiplication, dot product, transpose, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Number Generation: Numpy can generate random numbers, which is useful in statistical analyses, machine learning algorithms, and simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical Operations: Numpy provides many statistical methods such as mean, median, percentile, and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image Processing and Computer Graphics: Images can be manipulated via Numpy arrays. For example, you can reverse the colors of an image, convert an image to grayscale, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scientific Computing: Numpy is used in a wide range of scientific research areas, including physics, astronomy, and engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Machine Learning: Numpy is fundamental for machine learning. Many other libraries (like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch) are built on top of Numpy and rely on its array operations.`"

    "##### `Whatâ€™s the difference between a Python list and a NumPy array?`\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy arrays and list arrays in Python are both used in data manipulation, but they are different in several ways. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Memory Efficiency: Numpy arrays are more memory efficient than Python lists\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Performance: Numpy arrays are faster than Python lists when it comes to mathematical operations. This is due to the fact that numpy uses optimized C API to perform computations, which is significantly faster than Python's built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functionality: Numpy provides a lot of functionality that Python lists do not have. For example, you can perform operations like arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc.), statistical operations (mean, median, etc.), and more on numpy arrays. Python lists do not support these operations directly and it's often required to use loops or list comprehensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Syntax: The numpy array follows the mathematical syntax, which makes it more convenient to use for mathematical operations. However, Python lists don't follow mathematical syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Size Flexibility: Python lists are dynamically resizable, whereas numpy arrays are not. If you want to resize a numpy array, a new array will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, you might want to use a numpy array if you are doing complex mathematical operations, especially on large data, and use lists for simpler, more general purpose tasks.\n",

    "##### `Numpy Arrays`\n",
    "\n",
    "In Numpy, `rank` and `shape` are attributes that give information about the dimensionality of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Rank`: The rank of a Numpy array is the number of dimensions of the array. For example, a 1D array has a rank of 1, a 2D array has a rank of 2, and so on. In Python, you can get the rank of a Numpy array using the ndim attribute (`array.ndim`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Shape`: The shape of a Numpy array is a tuple that gives the size of each dimension. For example, for a 2D array, the shape would be (n,m) where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. For a 3D array, the shape would be (n,m,p) where n is the number of stacks, m is the number of rows, and p is the number of columns. In Python, you can get the shape of a Numpy array using the shape attribute (`array.shape`)."

    "\n",
